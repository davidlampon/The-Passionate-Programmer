<h2>Tip 38: Change the world</h2>

<p>The worst thing anyone at work can ask about you is “what does he do?”. Having to answer this question means that they don’t know what you have done.</p>
<p>That’s what happens when you show up at work without a mission. You need to effect visible change through your team, organisation or company.</p>
<p>You should be doing this because you are internally driven to do them because you can’t stand back and watch the people in your company do things wrong. You know things could be better and you have to change them.</p>
