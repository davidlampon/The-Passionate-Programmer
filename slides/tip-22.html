<h2>Tip 22: Remember who you work for</h2>

<p>It’s really hard to make sure that your goals and your work align with the goals of your business but you should be aiming for it.</p>
<p>Look for the correct scope: organisation, department, project, team and make sure you align with it and grow from there.</p>
<p>Don’t worry if the scope is small if you align with your manager solving his problems, you are helping the project, the team and the company.</p>
