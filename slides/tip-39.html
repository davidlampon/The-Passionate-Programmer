<h2>Tip 39: Let your voice be heard</h2>

<p>If you want to write your ticket you have to think bigger than the IT workers of yesteryear. You need to think beyond the next promotion or even your current place of employment.</p>
<p>Set your sights higher. Donâ€™t think of yourself as a programmer at a specific company but as a participating member of an industry.</p>
<p>Read weblogs, start your own, expand your network and speak at small meet ups and start before you think you are prepared. You have something to sell and teach although you are not feeling 100% prepared.</p>
