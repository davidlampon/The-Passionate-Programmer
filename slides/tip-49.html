<h2>Tip 49: The fat man in the mirror</h2>

<p>If you are constantly exposed to something it’s hard to see it changing unless change happens rapidly. Same may happen with your career.</p>
<p>Suddenly one day you look yourself at the mirror your job doesn’t fit you anymore and you have to react quickly or get a new job.</p>
<p>It’s hard to measure the marketability of your current skills. A third party (friend, tutor, manager) would be a great advisor to know where your blind spots are. Don’t try to fix them all but know that they are there. Bad things happen when you are blind to your blind spots.</p>
