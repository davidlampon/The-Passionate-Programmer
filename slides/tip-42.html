<h2>Tip 42: Remarkability</h2>

<p>The best way to get a customer to remark on a product is to make your product remarkable. The only way to stand out in the crows is to be outstanding.</p>
<p>To be remarkable means not only that something is good but that is worthy of attention. To be remarkable you have to be significantly different from those around you.</p>
<p>To become remarkable you have to start doing because being is not good enough. Don’t let yourself be the best in the bunch, be the person and do the things that people can’t not talk about.</p>
