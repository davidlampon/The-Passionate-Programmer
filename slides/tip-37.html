<h2>Tip 37: Suit speak</h2>

<p>Clients and managers wants products to be fast although they donâ€™t care about requests per second.</p>
<p>Businesses and those who run them are interested in business results so marketing your accomplishments in any language other than the language of business is ineffective.</p>
<p>Have your elevator speech ready (just in case). Could you express the benefits of the work you did last week to your CEO in a totally non technical language?</p>
