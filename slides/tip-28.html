<h2>Tip 28: Eight-hour burn</h2>

<p>The general accepted idea is that you have to work so relentlessly that you can’t work any longer than eight hours per day. When it comes to work less can really be more. When we are tired we are not productive, when we are burned out we are not creative.</p>
<p>Important thing is getting things done, not working more hours. You can’t keep the pace of a sprint and finish a marathon. If you have a constraint of eight hours you set goals, organise and plan your work to finish everything in that time window.</p>
