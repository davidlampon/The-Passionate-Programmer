<h2>Tip 4: Be the worst</h2>

<p>Being the worst means you work with people that are better and you and from who you can constantly learn.</p>
<p>Being the worst doesnâ€™t mean you are that bad.</p>
<p>Being surrounded by good people automatically makes you better or potentially better, is your choice to take the chance.</p>
<p>Assuming you are the worst humbles you and allows you to embrace learning.</p>
