<h2>Tip 51: Avoid waterfall career planning</h2>

<p>The most complex project you can face is your own career. If you plan your career as a rigid structure in a constantly changing environment you will get out of track before you realise.</p>
<p>The cost of change is not always hard but you have to make sure itâ€™s worthy the effort. Change in your career is not only possible but necessary.</p>
<p>Set big goals and make constant corrections along the way. Learn form experience and change the goals as you go.</p>
