<h2>Tip 45: You’ve already lost your job</h2>

<p>The job you were hired to do no longer exists. You might still be drawing a pay check, adding value and making your employer happy but you already lost your job because everything is changing very fast.</p>
<p>Keep doing your job but don’t get to confortable. You are not your job, don’t identify with something statically when everything is moving so fast. Don’t aim for the target, aim for the place were the target is moving to.</p>
