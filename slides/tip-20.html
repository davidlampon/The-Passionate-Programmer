<h2>Tip 20: Mind reader</h2>

<p>At times you can get things done before the manager or the client asks for it if you pay close attention and have a good sight of the full picture of the project and the organisation.</p>
<p>Standing one step in front of the requirements of managers and clients makes you almost a magician for them.</p>
<p>Anyway you need a safety nest, if you are supposed to be doing work that no one has asked for be sure when you start doing it that you don’t break anything or spent your company’s time or nothing.</p>
