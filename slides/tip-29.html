<h2>Tip 29: Learn how to fail</h2>

<p>Finding an error early saves a lot of time in the future trying to fix it. Don’t trust any piece of software that hasn’t shown error and bugs on the development phase. That means that the developers aren’t aware of their flaws and even worse they are not detected neither fixed.</p>
<p>Learning to deal with mistakes is a skill that is both valuable and difficult to teach. We don’t judge each other on the mistakes we make but on how we deal with them</p>
<p>Raise an issue as early as possible, take the blame, offer a solution and ask for help.</p>
