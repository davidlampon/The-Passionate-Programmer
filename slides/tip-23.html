<h2>Tip 23: Be where you’re at</h2>

<p>[manager’s perspective] The most frustrating thing is to deal with is an employee who’s always aiming for the next rung on the ladder. He is living in the next job he’s usually doing a mediocre job in his current role.</p>
<p>How the management see this guy? He’s a mediocre performer with a bad attitude. Potential and talent doesn’t make money and this kind of attitude makes your managers want to stop investing in you.</p>
<p>It’s good to have ambitions and goals but be focussed on the present moment and enjoy the small victories of the daily work life.</p>
