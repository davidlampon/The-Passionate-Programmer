<h2>Tip 2: Supply and demand</h2>

<p>As the supply increases the price gets lower and lower every time, competition decreases prices down.</p>
<p>Offshore countries like India are injecting a lot of low price engineers in very stable technologies which increases the supply and lowers the prices.</p>
<p>A good choice would be to focus on technologies that are not totally stable as offshore doesnâ€™t take chances on new technologies.</p>
<p>Only chance in trendy techs is to be on a higher tier to be able to lead and provide quality levels on other work.</p>
