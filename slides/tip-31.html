<h2>Tip 31: Donâ€™t panic</h2>

<p>Be relaxed, always think about what to do next and be aware of your current context. If you react negatively on a critical situation you get nothing.</p>
<p>We panic because we loose perspective, we focus all out attention on the problem, which is both a good way to approach and try to solve the problem and making it more important than it is.</p>
<p>With a third person perspective form the outside, any problem could be laughable so just go ahead with it, try not to make it worse than it is an get it fixed.</p>
