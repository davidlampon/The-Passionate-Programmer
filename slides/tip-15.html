<h2>Tip 15: Practice, practice, practice</h2>

<p>As an industry we have to make time for practice. We have to stop treating our jobs as a practice session. We have to invest time in our craft.</p>
<p>When you practice it doesn’t have to look nice or work well. It’s the practice itself what rewards you with more knowledge and being exposes to error and mistakes of which you can learn from.</p>
<p>If all you do is perfect and nice you are not stretching yourself enough. Practice at your limits to expand them.</p>
